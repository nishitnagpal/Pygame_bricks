# Bricks
Classic game of hitting bricks with a ball from a sliding bar. 

Designed with Pygame - a Python library - the game allows you to control a sliding bar with keyboard controls to hit the ball at desired angle and space to remove all the bricks from display. The game provides option to pause during gameplay and start again on losing. With time taken and score as display you can get competitive while playing in turn with other people. I have added random ball motion while starting the game to avoid the ball hitting the same spot every time game is started. Basic physis have been applied to ball - sliding bar interaction so that the bar can be positioned to release the ball at the required angle to remove maximum bricks.

GitHub Pages primarily supports static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Pygame, however, is a Python library that requires a Python interpreter to run, which GitHub Pages does not support natively. Firstly, I created an index.html file to include a canvas for drawing the game and a script reference. Then restructured the Python application using JavaScript. I used HTML5 Canvas for drawing and basic JavaScript for the game logic.
